    <h1>For You</h1>

    <p class="entry-text">
        I didn’t plan this.
        Somewhere between the quiet conversations,
        the late replies, and the way you simply exist —
        you became something important to me.
        <br><br>
        So I made something.
        Just for you.
    </p>

    There’s something about your eyes.
    <br><br>
    They don’t just look beautiful —
    they feel calm.
    Like they hold softness without even trying.
    When you look at the camera,
    it doesn’t feel posed.
    It feels real.

    And your smile…
    <br><br>
    It’s not loud.
    It’s not forced.
    It’s the kind that slowly grows —
    and somehow makes everything around it lighter.
    <br><br>
    You don’t even realize what it does.
    But I do.

    I don’t know when it happened.
    But I started noticing details.
    The way you stand.
    The way you hold yourself.
    The quiet confidence.
    <br><br>
    And somewhere in that —
    I fell for you.

    If I’m honest —
    it was never just about how you look.
    <br><br>
    It’s the way you make things feel.
    Softer.
    Warmer.
    Real.
